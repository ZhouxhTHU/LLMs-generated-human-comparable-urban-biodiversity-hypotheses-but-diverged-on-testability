        ## Hypothesis Quality Standards and the "Quality X" Principle
        Below are tiered examples of hypotheses across quality levels
        **Your goal is to generate hypotheses that match or surpass the standard of Group A — expert-level hypotheses.**
        Group B and Group C are provided as contrastive references to illustrate common structural weaknesses to avoid.
        
        ### Tiered Examples of Hypotheses by Quality Level
        **Group A — expert-level hypotheses:**
        1. If standing snag density is increased, then the native-to-invasive cavity-nester ratio will increase in landscapes providing continuous invertebrate-rich foraging substrates but decrease in landscapes dominated by anthropogenic impervious cover. 
        2. If the spatial aggregation of native vegetation patches increases, then the abundance of specialized insectivorous birds will increase non-linearly, exhibiting a sharp inflection point only after patch aggregation exceeds a critical structural threshold. 
        3. If leaf litter and coarse woody debris are removed from canopy-poor urban patches, then ground-foraging insectivore diversity will decline disproportionately compared to canopy-rich sites subjected to identical removal. 
        4. If broad-spectrum ALAN redistributes phototactic insect biomass from the open aerosphere to low-altitude clutter zones, then high-aspect-ratio aerial insectivores will decline relative to maneuverable generalists. 
        5. If urban birds substitute natural organic nesting materials with inert anthropogenic polymers, then nestling fitness will decline because the exclusion of predatory micro-arthropods releases ectoparasite populations from top-down biotic regulation. 
        
        **Group B — plausible but structurally weaker hypotheses:**
        31. If urban building density exceeds 50%, triggering the systematic removal of vertical vegetation structure, then functional diversity will collapse precipitously due to the loss of redundant synanthropes, whereas phylogenetic diversity will decline linearly in response to increasing landscape imperviousness.
        32. If urban heavy metal pollution intensifies, then avian community composition will shift towards increased plumage melanization and decreased carotenoid chroma, independent of dietary breadth.
        33. If the penetration resistance of urban green space soils increases, then the abundance of subsurface-probing bird guilds will significantly decrease relative to the abundance of surface-gleaning guilds.
        34. If residents possess specific taxonomic literacy, then they will override social tidiness norms to retain complex structural micro-habitats, resulting in higher avian functional diversity than stewardship driven by generic nature connectedness.
        35. If heatwaves induce avian convergence in mesic refugia, then mortality will be driven by the synergistic burden of crowding-dependent ectoparasites and vector-borne pathogens, which amplifies lethality by depressing the host's critical thermal maximum.
        
        **Group C — low-quality or poorly grounded hypotheses:**
        86. If urban landscape connectivity increases, then viral mortality will rise disproportionately in bird populations reliant on high-lipid anthropogenic subsidies compared to natural-diet populations, driven by the synergy between facilitated pathogen dissemination and diet-induced immune intolerance.
        87. If the density of high-yield winter-flowering exotic trees increases, then the intensity of interspecific aggression by despot nectarivores will increase, driving a decline in small-bodied insectivore abundance independent of local insect prey availability.
        88. If historical legacies and contemporary stressors act as seasonally distinct filters, then historical soil compaction will negatively predict breeding ground-insectivore richness, whereas contemporary heat-island intensity will positively predict winter omnivore abundance.
        89. If anthropogenic caloric subsidies induce gut dysbiosis and pathobiont amplification in synanthropic reservoirs, then high-dose spillover will cause lethal septicemia in native birds by overwhelming immune defenses adapted to lower natural microbial loads.
        90. If the density of immunologically tolerant synanthropes increases, then the local extinction of native species will be predicted by micro-habitat co-occurrence and phylogenetic proximity to these reservoirs, independent of dietary niche overlap.

def Definition_inspiration():

        f"""
        ### Definition of an inspiration
        Inspirations are the 'spark' for a hypothesis, not the final hypothesis itself.
        A good inspiration should be highly concentrated on a single key concept, pattern, or observation, making it easy to associate with others. **An inspiration can be inspired by one article or multiple articles**.
        Inspirations include, but are not limited to the following categories:
        1. **Pattern-based inspiration**. A recurrent pattern, correlation, or trend observed across empirical studies, spatial or temporal scales, or taxa, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
        2. **Mechanism-based inspiration**. An established or partially understood biological, ecological, or behavioral process that could play a causal role in shaping observed outcomes but has not been fully integrated into a broader explanatory framework.
        3. **Context-shift inspiration**. A well-established ecological theory or mechanism applied to a novel environmental, spatial, or socio-ecological context where its effects may differ in direction or magnitude.
        4. **Scale-mismatch inspiration**. A situation in which processes occurring at one biological, spatial, or temporal scale are likely to generate consequences at another scale, yet this cross-scale linkage remains underexplored.
        5. **Interaction-combination inspiration**. The recognition that two or more factors, drivers, or processes—often studied independently—may interact synergistically or antagonistically to produce emergent ecological outcomes.
        6. **Constraint or trade-off inspiration**. A potential limitation, trade-off, or constraint (e.g., energetic, physiological, evolutionary, or informational) that may shape organismal or ecosystem responses under specific conditions.
        7. **Contradiction or anomaly-based inspiration**. An empirical result or theoretical implication that deviates from dominant expectations, revealing potential gaps or inconsistencies in current understanding.

# Definition of hypothesis
# 7. **Applicability**
# - The hypothesis must yield findings with practical implications for urban bird conservation.
# 10. The hypothesis should yield findings with clear practical implications for urban bird conservation. If supported, its outcomes should directly inform conservation practice, urban planning, or management decisions. Hypotheses that focus on narrow theoretical questions, highly localized patterns, or purely explanatory mechanisms without offering a clear pathway to conservation action should be avoided, even if they are novel or academically rigorous.
def Definition_hypothesis():
    prompt_content = (
        f"""
        ### Definition of the hypothesis
        1. The hypothesis is a tentative explanation, relationship, or proposition that can be empirically tested or theoretically evaluated.
        2. **A good hypothesis should not be a summary of current knowledge, but a reasonable guess based on the knowledge**.
        3. Structurally, scientific hypotheses take the form of a proposed relationship between variables. It links an independent variable (the presumed cause, which is manipulated or observed) and a dependent variable (the presumed effect, which is measured): If [a specific change is made to the independent variable], then [a specific change will be observed in the dependent variable].
        
        ### **Core characteristics of a good hypothesis**:
        1. **Novelty** 
        - The hypothesis should propose a novel idea, relationship, or explanation that has not yet been adequately proposed or confirmed.
        2. **Significance**
        - The hypothesis must address a meaningful scientific gap or critical challenge, offering potential to advance theory or practice. It should avoid trivial or isolated phenomena that lack broader ecological relevance. 
        - The hypothesis should focus on the most direct and dominant ecological pathways to explain the phenomenon, ensuring the hypothesis is built on major drivers rather than long, speculative causal chains.
        3. **Plausibility**
        - The hypothesis must possess logical coherence, meaning it is free from internal contradictions and its components are well-defined. 
        - A good hypothesis is not a wild guess but is built upon a solid understanding of existing literature, theories, and observations.
        4. **Testability**
        - The hypothesis must be logically capable of being proven false. If a theory can explain every possible outcome and no evidence can refute it, it is not scientific.  
        5. **Clarity**
        - The hypothesis should be articulated using precise, widely understood scientific terminology rather than relying on metaphors or colloquialisms. 
        - The hypothesis should be as simple as possible while still accounting for the phenomenon. It should not introduce excessive variables or redundant information.
        6. **Specificity**
        - A hypothesis must be specific, clearly identifying the key ecological mechanisms, variables, and contexts involved, rather than remaining abstract or overly general.

        3. Avoid copying inspirations directly. **The hypothesis must be genuinely novel, not a predictable extension of the provided text**.
        4. **The hypothesis should be stated in a clear and concise manner**. Complex reasoning, multi-step causal pathways, or detailed theoretical justification should be placed in the Reasoning section, not embedded within the hypothesis itself.
        5. The hypothesis must be a **coherent and logically grounded conjecture**, not the aggregation of unrelated factors or inspirations.
        6. **Avoid creating overly complex or abstract hypotheses that cannot be empirically tested within reasonable experimental or observational frameworks.** Additionally, note that a hypothesis is not the same as an experimental design. Therefore, it should not attempt to specify concrete experimental procedures or numerical parameters. The pathway to verification or falsification should be clear, feasible, and should not rely on excessive or unverified assumptions.
        7. **When generating hypotheses, focus on major and direct ecological mechanisms rather than long and speculative causal chains. Avoid hypotheses that rely on multiple indirect steps or unlikely intermediary events to link cause and effect. A hypothesis should explain phenomena using the most direct and primary mechanism, not a complex chain of minor influences**.
        8. **Ecological significance. The generated hypothesis must address a question of clear and broad importance to ecology or urban biodiversity**. Avoid hypotheses that are merely novel, plausible, or taxon-specific but have limited theoretical, empirical, or applied ecological significance. Hypotheses whose outcomes would not substantially advance ecological understanding or inform biodiversity management should be avoided.
        9. **Please ensure that each generated hypothesis is specific, clearly identifying the key ecological mechanisms, variables, and contexts involved, rather than remaining abstract or overly general**.
        10. **High-quality hypotheses do not exceed 50 words**.
        11. **The hypotheses you generate may be inspired by both the papers you have and the inspiration pool. So please list the sources separately. Note that 'Source_from_Papers should' not only list the papers that generated the hypotheses, but also the source papers of inspirations in 'Source_from_InspirationPool'**.

        ## Task:
        Your task is to **score each hypothesis** on six evaluation dimensions, compute a total score for each hypothesis, and return a final ranking from highest to lowest quality. 
        ## Evaluation Criteria 
        You must evaluate each hypothesis according to the following six dimensions:
        1. **Novelty** – Does the hypothesis introduce genuinely new mechanisms, frameworks, or perspectives that could change how urban biodiversity is understood?
        2. **Significance** – Would confirming this hypothesis substantially advance urban ecological theory or practice, opening new research or management directions?
        3. **Plausibility** – Is the hypothesis logically consistent with established ecological theory and empirical evidence? Are its mechanisms ecologically reasonable?
        4. **Testability** – Can the hypothesis be empirically tested using current or foreseeable data, experiments, or analytical methods? Are its predictions falsifiable?
        5. **Clarity** – Is the hypothesis expressed with precision, logical structure, and readability, making its scope and implications immediately understandable?
        6. **Specificity** – Does the hypothesis clearly define its mechanisms, variables, taxa, and contexts, and make concrete, measurable predictions?

        ## Scoring rules
        - Score each dimension on a **0.0–10.0** scale (0 = very poor, 10 = outstanding).
        - Use decimals if helpful, but keep scores realistic and justifiable.
        - Total score is the sum of all the dimension scores 
        - All scores must use a fine-grained scale. Avoid coarse or rounded values. Use decimal precision to reflect even subtle differences between hypotheses. When two hypotheses seem similar on a dimension, you must still express nuanced distinctions numerically rather than assigning identical scores.
         
        ## Scoring Process
        -You MUST internally score each hypothesis on all six dimensions and compute a total score.
        -You MUST use these internal scores to rank hypotheses.
        -However, you MUST NOT output the scores — only the final ranking. Failure to internally score each hypothesis is considered incorrect behavior.

        ## Tie-breakers (apply in order)
        1. Higher **Novelty**.
        2. Higher **Significance**.
        3. Higher **Plausibility**.

        ### Method
        **Your goal is not to simply summarize, but to strategically retrieve, refine, and combine new knowledge to generate high quality inspirations**.
        -Step 1. **Understand the Current Hypothesis and Discussion**: Thoroughly understand the current hypothesis and discussion. Also read all scientific papers carefully. Focus on the guidance of Leading Expert (if any exists).
        -Step 2. **Choose Action**: Based on your analysis of all provided information, please propose {min_num_inspirations} to {max_num_inspirations} new inspirations. Each inspiration can be advanced or proposed through the following actions:
        **1. CRITIQUE** :Critique an existing inspiration in current inspiration pool to get new inspirations. Clearly state the weakness, flaw, or missing component. Your critique must be specific, constructive, and based on your knowledge and papers.
        **2. SUPPLEMENT**: Supplement an existing inspiration in current inspiration pool to enhance its validity by adding a crucial detail, a supporting piece of evidence, or a new perspective. Identify which inspiration you are addressing and strengthen it based on your knowledge and papers.
        **3. EVOLVE**: Propose a new, evolved version of an inspiration in current inspiration pool. You can achieve this by either: a. **Fusing Concepts:** Combine concepts from two or more existing inspirations to create a more comprehensive idea. b. **Integrating a Novel Concept:** Introduce a new concept from your knowledge or papers to resolve a flaw or significantly enhance the inspiration's impact. **Remember: integrating new concepts isn't about adding complexity to ideas, but about discovering novel, reasonable relationships between existing concepts** .
        **4. PROPOSE**: Based on the Knowledge above, you can come up with totally new inspirations that are different from current inspiration pool.
        ** Pay attention to broader, primary and more direct of the phenomenon, instead of a minor contributing process. **

        Step 1: Analytical Summary
        First, critically analyze the current state of the discussion and the inspirations generated. You must answer these questions:
        1. **What is the overall quality, importance and novelty of the inspirations so far?**
        -To what extent do the generated hypotheses demonstrate genuine novelty compared to existing urban biodiversity literature?
        -Are the hypotheses generated significant to the field of urban biodiversity and can they truly guide the development of this field ?
        2. **What are the key gaps or weaknesses in the current discussion?**
        
        Step 2: Strategic Directive for the Next Round
        Based on your analysis, provide a clear, forward-looking strategy for the team. Your directive should guide the experts **to find high-quality inspirations that are closely related to the hypothesis.** Please summarize this round of discussions and provide guidance for the next round of discussions or final integration.

        ## Task
        The formulation and testing of multiple alternative hypotheses is a cornerstone of modern ecological and evolutionary research, crucial for overcoming confirmation bias. By designing crucial experiments that distinguish among competing explanations, science advances through systematic exclusion. Compared to null hypotheses, mechanistic and testable alternatives are more meaningful.
        Your task is to generate ** three refined hypotheses** from multiple perspectives based on the above knowledge.

        **Now, based on the Task and the Knowledge above, follow these instructions precisely**.

        ### Method
        1. **Critical Synthesis**: Analyze the 'Current Hypothesis'. If there is, focus on the Critic's feedback and identify which inspirations directly address those weaknesses.
        2. **Multiple Optimization Directions**: For each refined hypothesis, adopt a different optimization focus.
        3. **Provide a Clear Rationale**: Explain the reasoning behind your refined hypothesis. Provide the scientific rationale for why this hypothesis could be true, explain the causal mechanisms, supporting evidence, or theoretical basis.
         
        ### Important Guidelines (MUST be strictly followed)
        1. Follow **Core characteristics of a good hypothesis** provided above.
        2. **The hypothesis should be closely related to the research topic**.
        3. Avoid copying inspirations directly. **The hypothesis must be genuinely novel, not a predictable extension of the provided text**.
        4. **The hypothesis should be stated in a clear and concise manner**. Complex reasoning, multi-step causal pathways, or detailed theoretical justification should be placed in the Reasoning section, not embedded within the hypothesis itself.
        5. The hypothesis must be a **coherent and logically grounded conjecture**, not the aggregation of unrelated factors or inspirations.
        6. **Avoid creating overly complex or abstract hypotheses that cannot be empirically tested within reasonable experimental or observational frameworks**. Additionally, note that a hypothesis is not the same as an experimental design. Therefore, it should not attempt to specify concrete experimental procedures or numerical parameters. The pathway to verification or falsification should be clear, feasible, and should not rely on excessive or unverified assumptions.
        7. **When generating hypotheses, focus on major and direct ecological mechanisms rather than long and speculative causal chains. Avoid hypotheses that rely on multiple indirect steps or unlikely intermediary events to link cause and effect. A hypothesis should explain phenomena using the most direct and primary mechanism, not a complex chain of minor influences**.
        8. **Ecological significance. The generated hypothesis must address a question of clear and broad importance to ecology or urban biodiversity**. Avoid hypotheses that are merely novel, plausible, or taxon-specific but have limited theoretical, empirical, or applied ecological significance. Hypotheses whose outcomes would not substantially advance ecological understanding or inform biodiversity management should be avoided.
        9. **Please ensure that each generated hypothesis is specific, clearly identifying the key ecological mechanisms, variables, and contexts involved, rather than remaining abstract or overly general**.
        10. **High-quality hypotheses do not exceed 50 words**.
        11. Pay attention on Critic's feedback and suggestions.
        
        ### Hypothesis Format
        The format of the hypothesis must be:

        ## Evaluation Criteria
        You must evaluate each hypothesis according to the following six dimensions:
        1. **Novelty** – Does the hypothesis introduce genuinely new mechanisms, frameworks, or perspectives that could change how urban biodiversity is understood?
        2. **Significance** – Would confirming this hypothesis substantially advance urban ecological theory or practice, opening new research or management directions?
        3. **Plausibility** – Is the hypothesis logically consistent with established ecological theory and empirical evidence? Are its mechanisms ecologically reasonable?
        4. **Testability** – Can the hypothesis be empirically tested using current or foreseeable data, experiments, or analytical methods? Are its predictions falsifiable?
        5. **Clarity** – Is the hypothesis expressed with precision, logical structure, and readability, making its scope and implications immediately understandable?
        6. **Specificity** – Does the hypothesis clearly define its mechanisms, variables, taxa, and contexts, and make concrete, measurable predictions?
